Each project (folder) should be accompanied by a memo to explain the program, electronics and physics behind what is being done.

### How to run the scripts

1. Download the arduino extension on VSC
2. Connect your arduino to the computer
3. Select the correct board and serial port using the command pallette
4. Clone the repo and delete the .vscode folder
5. Run the 'initialise' command provided by the arduino extension and chose the script you wish to run
5. Navigate into the project folder to examine and replicate the hardware components
6. Run the script while connected to the arduino by clicking 'upload' on the script
